.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_crq_sign2 \- This function will sign a Certificate request with a key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_crq_sign2(gnutls_x509_crq_t " crq ", gnutls_x509_privkey_t " key ", gnutls_digest_algorithm_t " dig ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_x509_crq_t crq" 12
should contain a gnutls_x509_crq_t structure
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t key" 12
holds a private key
.IP "gnutls_digest_algorithm_t dig" 12
The message digest to use. GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1 is the safe choice unless you know what you're doing.
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
must be 0
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will sign the certificate request with a private key.
This must be the same key as the one used in \fBgnutls_x509_crt_set_key()\fP since a
certificate request is self signed.

This must be the last step in a certificate request generation since all
the previously set parameters are now signed.

Returns 0 on success.
