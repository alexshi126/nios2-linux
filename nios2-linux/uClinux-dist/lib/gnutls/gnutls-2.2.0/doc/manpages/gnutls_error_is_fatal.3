.SH NAME
gnutls_error_is_fatal \- Returns non-zero in case of a fatal error
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_error_is_fatal(int " error ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "int error" 12
is an error returned by a gnutls function. Error should be a negative value.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
If a function returns a negative value you may feed that value
to this function to see if it is fatal. Returns 1 for a fatal 
error 0 otherwise. However you may want to check the
error code manually, since some non\-fatal errors to the protocol
may be fatal for you (your program).

This is only useful if you are dealing with errors from the
record layer or the handshake layer.

For positive \fIerror\fP values, 0 is returned.
