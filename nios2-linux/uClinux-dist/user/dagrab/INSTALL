INSTALL file for dagrab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Edit head of const.h (not neccessary -- default settings for dagrab).

2. Edit head of the Makefile 
   - comment out PTHREAD support if you for example do not like linking
     pthread library

3. Recompile yourself as usually. For example
   make; make install

4. Ordinary users need read permission to CD-ROM device.
   If it is for example /dev/hdc:	root# chmod +r /dev/hdc

   Note: some distributions (RH) can reset permissions to their defaults after
   reboot.
