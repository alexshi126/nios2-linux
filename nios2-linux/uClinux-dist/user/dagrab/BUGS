BUGS file for dagrab
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some bugs: 

* The left and right channel can be changed. It depends on a drive how it reads
  the first block -- it can be 2 bytes shifted. I have no idea how to fix it.
  (probably it is cd-rom's bug)

* Can't deal with title/author on more than one line when using cddb. Because
  I'm lazy.

* Can not receive cddb data using the proxy or www, ... Source file cddb.c is
  probably obsolete and should be completely rewritten.
