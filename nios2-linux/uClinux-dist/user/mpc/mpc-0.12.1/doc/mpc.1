.SH "SYNOPSIS"
mpc [<command> <arguments>]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
mpc is a client for MPD, the Music Player Daemon.  mpc connects to a MPD and

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BI --format
.br
Configure the format of song display for status and the playlist.  The metadata delimeters are "%name%", "%artist%", "%album%", "%title%", "%track%", "%time%", and "%file%".  The [] operator is used to group output such that if no metadata delimeters are found or matched between '[' and ']', then none of the characters between '[' and ']' are output.  '&' and '|' are logical operators for and and or.  '#' is used to escape characters.  Some useful examples for format are: "%file%" and "[[%artist% - ]%title%]|[%file%]".
This command also takes the following defined escape sequences:
.br
\\\\ - backslash
.br
\\a - alert
.br
\\b - backspace
.br
\\t - tab
.br
\\n - newline
.br
\\v - vertical tab

.SH "BUGS"

.SH "NOTE"
Since MPD uses UTF\-8, mpc needs to convert characters to the
charset used by the local system. If you get character conversion errors when you're running mpc you probably need to set up your locale. This is done by setting any of the LC_CTYPE, LANG or LC_ALL enviroment vatiables (LC_CTYPE only affects character handling).
