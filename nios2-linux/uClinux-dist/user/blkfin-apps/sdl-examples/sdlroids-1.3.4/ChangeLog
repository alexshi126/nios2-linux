2001-03-27  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* Version 1.3.4 released.

	* hyperoid.c (main): Don't draw during pause. This caused a crash
	in windows when iconifying from fullscreen mode. Unfortunately
	this also means that the nice little "PAUSED" text isn't shown.
	(RestartHyperoid): Also show version on the intro screen.

	* sdlroids.6.in: Updated to include the new keybindings.

	* sdl.c (init_graphics): Don't do SDL_ShowCursor(0) until the
	video mode is selected or you'll get a crash when using DGA2
	rendering (and possibly others).
	(update_graphics): Improved fullscreen/window toggling. Added
	Ctrl-g binding to grab+hide / release+show mouse pointer. Added
	Ctrl-z key binding which iconifies and pauses the game.

2001-03-26  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* autogen.sh: Removed a bashism.

2001-03-23  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* sdl.c: Added code to do scaled blitting for the status bar when
	it's smaller than 16 pixels. Scale blit code written by Greg
	Velichansky <hmaon@bumba.net>.

2001-03-23  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>
	
	* sdlroids.6.in: Updated date.

	* configure.in, Makefile.am (windows): Various changes needed to
	compile for Windows.
	
	* icons/sdlroids.ico: Added Windows .ico file.

	* sdlroids.rc.in: Windows resource file for the icon.
	
	* autogen.sh: Change directory to srcdir before running.

2001-03-13  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* sdlsound.c: Always include stdlib.h for exit declaration.

	* sdl.c: Include string.h for memset() declaration.

2000-11-27  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* Version 1.3.3 released. Adds support for joystick control.

	* sdl.c (IsKeyDown): Now it doesn't crash when there are no
	joysticks present.

2000-10-25  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* configure.in: Added check for setenv.

	* sdl.c: Added support for joysticks.
	
	* getargs.c (pov), getargs.h: Added new joystick related options.

 	* hyperoid.c (DrawPlayer): Fixed analog joystick control. 

	* graphics.h: Changed prototype for IsKeyDown.

	* sdlroids.6.in: Added documentation about the new joystick support.
	
2000-07-16  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* Version 1.3.2 released. 
	
	* sdlroids.6.in: Changed date to Jul 17th. 

	* Makefile.am (SDLRoids.txt): Added target to build text version
	of the manual.

	* hyperoid.c (RestartHyperoid): Fixed bug which reset shield and
	num bombs after an astroid crash.

	* rand.c, rand.h: Better rand functions.

2000-07-15  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* roidsupp.c (datafilename): Removed forgotten debug.

	* sdlroids.6.in: Document SRDATADIR environment variable.

	* roidsupp.c (datafilename): Concatenates two strings and does
	filename environment magic.

	* sdlsound.c, hyperoid.c, sdl.c: Now tries a number of things to
	find the data files including the current directory, the directory
	of the binary and the directory pointed to by the environment
	variable SRDATADIR. Thanks to David Powell <avid@mad.scientist.com>
	for the suggestions. This is _mainly_ for the BeOS support, but
	not only. 
	
	* sdlsound.h: Renamed from sound.h

	* hyperoid.c, sdl.c: Removed double buffering code since it was
	way to slow. Optimized updating significantly (seems like about 2x
	the speed) by updating all rectangles by themselves instead of
	individually. Also fixed locking of the surface so the fullscreen
	mode works correctly in BeOS (bad me!).
	
2000-07-14  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* Makefile.am (beos): Added a BeOS target that sets resources
	(icon etc) for the binary and also set files' mime-types.

2000-07-11  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* sdl.c: Use a static table for coordinate conversion. Seems
	slightly (marginally might be a better word) faster. 

2000-07-10  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* petopt.c, configure.in: Check for syslog. Another BeOS fix.

	* hyperoid.c (do_sleep): New function for sleeping the SDL
	way. SDLRoids now compile and run on BeOS.

	* sdlsound.c (play_audio): Fixed typo when not using SDL_mixer,
	and also fixed a type error.	

	* Version 1.3.1 released.
	
	* sdlroids.6.in: Improved documentation and increased date.

2000-07-09  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* sdl.c (score_graphics): Fixed some bugs in the drawing of the
	score. I also move the display of the score if the window is
	resized, which makes it look nicer. Also use scaling if the score
	would be too small to fit in the window. It uses SDL_SoftStretch,
	which isn't perfect but at least works ok.

	* hyperoid.c: Shields now work differently. Now you have a certain
	amount of "shields" which gets drained as you use them, ie when
	you have the shield button pressed. I believe this is nicer since
	it gives the player more control.

	* misc.h, hyperoid.c: Added a struct of the player which contains
	information like lives etc. Makes for a cleaner "global"
	namespace, which I like.

	* sdl.c (drawcircle): Function to draw a circle. Slightly modified
	version of the SGE library function.

	* hyperoid.c (DrawShield): Shield is now drawn as a circle around
	the ship instead of the previous ugly thing. Looks a lot
	better. :)

	* sdl.c (bmp2surface): Convert loaded image surfaces to the
	current visual.
	
	* hyperoid.c, sdl.c, sdlsound.c: Free loaded / allocated data at
	exit. Not really necessary but nice programming standards. Also
	renamed init/exit functions to a more uniform version.

	* configure.in (VERSION): Added microversion and made the CVS
	version 1.3.1 instead of 1.4.

	* sdl.c (graphics_init, load_images): Now setting the window title
	and icon caption, as well as the icon bitmap.

2000-07-08  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>
	
	* Version 1.3 released.
	
	* sdlroids.6.in: Added documentation for all new options.

	* sdl.c (graphics_init): Use the specified geometry if available.

	* getargs.c (parse_option): Added version printing and extended
	the help printed with --help. Also added geometry option.
	
	* hyperoid.c (main): Do command line parsing and added a benchmark
	mode that runs X frames without delay and quits, printing the FPS.

	* getargs.c, getargs.h: Implemented parsing of command line
	arguments using petopt.

	* petopt.c, petopt.h, README.petopt, Makefile.am: Added petopt
	files. Petopt is a small, open source argument parser.

	* hyperoid.c (FireShot): Added dual and tripple gun upgrades as
	well as upgrades that increased the range of the guns.

	* sdl.c (score_graphics): Only redraw score if something has changed.
	
	* hyperoid.c (DeleteBadguys): Deletes badguys from a list without
	exploding them. Used when restarting.

	* hyperoid.c (NewGame): Fixed bugs with starting a new game after
	the player died. 

2000-07-07  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>
	
	* sdl.c (sdl_drawpixel): Use a faster method in pixeldrawing,
	which basically doubles the speed. There's one function per bit
	depth - which one to use is cached. Also the r,g,b->Uint32 part is
	cached. 

	* sounds: Lowered volume on some sounds and replaced player shot
	sound.
	 
	* hyperoid.c: When the game is restarted due to death, the
	playfield is reset first (NewGame). Also lowered the restart delay
	some.

	* sdl.c (graphics_update): Play thrust sample in looping mode.

	* sdlsound.c (loopsam): Play/Stop playing looped sample.

	* hyperoid.c (HitPlayer): Changed so astroids, enemy ships etc
	explode if you hit them while the shield is on.

	* sdl.c (_sdl_drawpixel): New version of the function. Fixed bug
	where it would write outside the buffer causing a segfault

2000-07-06  David Hedbor  <david@hedbor.org>

	* Should have done this earlier, but here goes. This is now the
	SDL port tree. Improvements (other than the porting itself):
	
	Added Pause functionality, fixed centering of play area and
	drawing of boundary box around it, objects now wraps more nicely
	(before they kinda "popped" from one side to another), fixed
	flickering problem, added (ugly-looking) shield graphics instead
	of changing the color of the ship, added configure / automake,
	reindented the source.

2000-05-14  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* Version 1.2. (Starting here to carry on from Hyperoid's version
	number.)

	* Given up on finding the original author :-/ (since I'm merely
	prefixing the original name with `x' I felt I should really ask
	permission, as it were), and decided to just release it anyway.

	* gtk.c: fixed strange X errors on exit (it seems a gdk_flush()
	was needed in gc_init(), though I don't quite see why :-/). Also
	now works in mono, though not especially well.

2000-04-12  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* xhyperoid.6: created.

	* README: created.

	* Makefile: finished off and cleaned up a bit.

2000-03-26  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* Tweaked level.xpm and score.xpm to be more readable (well,
	slightly less *un*readable, anyway :-)).

	* gtk.c: finally got the X version sorted out. The big speed
	problem was with doing so many colour switches with a single GC;
	using multiple `single-colour' GCs avoided the need for that.

2000-03-24  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* gtk.c: first hack at an X version. Slow and jerky. :-(

2000-03-23  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* Sorted out sounds. They now seem at least reasonably
	appropriate.

2000-03-22  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* More concerted attempt at removing the most severe macro abuse.
	Also mass conversion of "//" comments.

2000-03-21  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* hyperoid.c: fixed segfault (from original code) where NULL
	pointer was occasionally dereferenced when breaking up an
	asteroid.

	* Got score and other status indication working.

2000-03-18  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* hyperoid.c: added sound support (lifted from zblast). Only the
	code is there at the moment; tested with zblast sounds, but need
	to put together some appropriate for this.

	* hyperoid.c: got a crude svgalib port mostly working - there's an
	intermittent segfault problem, but I suspect that was in the
	original code (not that that helps :-)), and I haven't implemented
	the score etc. display yet.

2000-03-17  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@dtn.ntl.com>

	* Started port. The first step is to try and remove the more
	obvious Windows dain bramage and unsightly Pascal/Modula-2-isms. I
	may be some time. ;-)
