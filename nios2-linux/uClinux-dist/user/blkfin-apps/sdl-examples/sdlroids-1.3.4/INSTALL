To install sdlroids, you need SDL 1.1.0 or newer. You optionally want
SDL_mixer as well. It's not required however. 

You can find them both at http://www.libsdl.org/ 

Compilation steps:

	1) Run ./configure
	2) Run make
	3) Run make install

If you install from CVS, you need to run ./autogen.sh prior to the
steps above.
