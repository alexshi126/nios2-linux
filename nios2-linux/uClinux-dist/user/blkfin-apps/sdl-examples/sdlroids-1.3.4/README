sdlroids - an enhanced shoot-the-asteroids game.
Copyright (C) 1991 Edward Hutchins.
Unix/Linux port by Russell Marks, 2000.
SDL port by David Hedbor <david@hedbor.org>


DESCRIPTION
-----------

Hyperoid was a really cool little game for Windows 3.x. It's
essentially an Asteroids clone, with decent game physics and
enhancements over the original game.

Once you've installed sdlroid , READ THE MAN PAGE. Some things about
it are a bit non-obvious, and it can save time to have them pointed
out.

Some of the improvements over xhyperoid are:

- Pause functionality.
- Fullscreen mode.
- Less flickering.
- Nicer place area (you can see the borders) and better edge handling
  (things just don't pop from one side to another).
- Uses SDL, and thus supports a more platforms. Can also use the esound
  daemon if SDL is compiled with it.
- Added configure scripts to simplify porting to different platforms.
