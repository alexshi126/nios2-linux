<h1>Bluetooth audio on embedded hardware</h1>

I would really like the bluetooth-alsa project to get far enough along
to really shine on embedded platforms. <a
href="http://www.gumstix.com">gumstix</a> is the perfect little device
for working this out.

<h3>Completed items</h3>

<ul>
<li>Modify btsco to build in a cross-compile buildroot environment (seems to have broken again in 2.6.14 buildroot)
<li>Tweak build so kernel module snd-hwdep-new gets built (need to make sure it gets installed automatically)
<li>Figure out hcid.conf settings and required modules for audio
<li>Fix timing problem in a2play--setitimer and rtc/pthreads timers
<li>Implemented unrolled and fixed-point a2dp encoder and fixed-point decoder
<li>Implemented 32-bit fixed point codec, made it the default fixed point, moving it into its own independent library
</ul>

<h3>Status</h3>

<ul>
<li>Stereo A2DP transmission (.au file) with a2play: audio breaks up occasionally but comes back (using -n flag)
<li>Live stereo transmission from line-in: occasional bursts of static (probably endian problems again)
<li>Stereo reception with a2recv: cpu is working hard and audio is working using subbands=4,blocks=4,bitpool=12 (should work with any settings now that decoder is in fixed-point)
<li>SCO (voice-quality audio) with btsco: gumstix connects to bluetooth headset and responds to headset controls but audio is not going through
<li>Some basic AVRCP code; able to receive commands in a separate process
</ul>

<h3>To-do</h3>

<ul>
<li>fix btsco.mk for 2.6.14+ buildroot
<li>Squash the last remaining quality problems with fixed point encoding (high frequencies are distorted) and retire floating point :)
<li>Set up AVRCP to control the stream
<li>Find out if future gumstix boards could have PCM pins from infineon connected to xscale (yes! confirmed!)
<li>Find out if SCO can be mapped to HCI as it can on CSR (maybe; see bluez-devel topic <a href="http://sourceforge.net/search/?forum_id=1881&group_id=26526&words=%22sco+over+uart%22&type_of_search=mlists">"SCO over UART"</a>)
<li>Try connecting a CSR bluetooth chip to see if audio works better (see next section)
</ul>

<h3>Bluetooth 1.1 CSR Module</h3>

The avantwave class 1 module is here. The specs are <a
href=btr-140.pdf>here</a> and the specific model is
btr140-h4-921k. Now I need to connect it up. I'm going to get access
to hirose pins through the tweener vias (tweener also has a 3.3v
converter which might be usable when I try a class 2 module)

hciattach times out complaining about no connection. I have a newer
module so I'm likely to spend additional effort getting it to work.

<h3>Notes</h3>

PSKEY_HOST_INTERFACE values are 1 (BCSP), 2 (USB), 3 (H4) so I thought
we need 3. In the end it was unnecessary to change this.

<p>

PSKEY_INITIAL_BOOTMODE (x3cd) should be 4 for HCI H4. It's shipped set
to 3 for USB.

<p>

PSKEY_UART_BAUDRATE (x1be) should be x1d8 for 115k or xebf for
921k. The default was 115k so I left it alone.

<p>

It seems that PSKEY_HOSTIO_MAP_SCO_PCM (x1ab) should be 0, equivalent
to the old "pskey mapsco 0" command. There is no x1ab key and
<tt>hciconfig hci0 revision</tt> indicates <b>SCO mapping: HCI</b> so
HCI must be the default routing.
