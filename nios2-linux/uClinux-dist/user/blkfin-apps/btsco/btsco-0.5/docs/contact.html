Please join us on the bluez-devel mailing list to work on this project
or provide feedback.

<p>

Sourceforge also provides forums and a place to submit patches, but
most of the BlueZ developers don't frequent the forums, so the mailing
list is the best place to reach us.

<p>If things aren't working as you expect, some of the things that can
help us track it down are:

<ul>
<li>Check to see you have installed bluez-passkey-gnome (debian, ubuntu)
<li>Whether there is a hub between your computer and bluetooth adapter (you should avoid this <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=11431438">especially if it's a usb 2.0 hub</a>)
<li>Manufacturer and model of headset and bluetooth adapter
<li>Output from <tt>hciconfig -a</tt>
<li>For using SCO, the output from <tt>hciconfig hci0 revision</tt> is helpful <b>(Run hciconfig as root) </b>

<ul>
<li>If it prints "SCO mapping: HCI" then your adapter should work.</li>
<li>If it prints "SCO mapping: PCM" then you might permanently change the setting using a command like "pskey mapsco 0" or "bccmd psset -s default 0x1ab 0" using bluez-utils-cvs but this is at your own risk.</li>
<li>If it doesn't print either of those, you probably need a different bluetooth adapter (preferably "CSR" based). You <b>might</b> be able to get a broadcom adapter to work but it may require that you boot with a kernel argument (<i>the force_scofix
parameter of the hci_usb driver?</i>) to force sco mtu values</li>
<li>If the adapter is made by Silicon Wave, it will not work. No one has gotten these things to do audio in linux.
</ul>

<li>Output from <tt>hcitool info bdaddr</tt> where bdaddr is the headset's address
<li>Output from <tt>hcidump -X -V</tt> while running btsco or a2play if appropriate
<li>Your kernel version and bluez userland versions or distro
<li>Result when trying it with a recent kernel if possible 
<li>If you have a headset that can do a2dp, try both SCO and A2DP
<li>If you can try another bluetooth adapter or headset, let us know if that helps (the adapters are cheap now, eh? :)
<li>If you can't pair or connect with the headset, did you pair it with another device? Did it help to reset the pairing by removing /etc/bluetooth/link_key or /var/lib/bluetooth/[dongleaddr]/linkkeys or by putting the headset in pair mode? You may have to redo this often if you try to dual-boot windows or if you use the same dongle on another computer. Be sure to set "auth disable" and "encrypt disable" in /etc/bluetooth/hcid.conf.
<li>Change the pin helper. Strangely it started working for me one time by using: <tt>pin_helper /usr/bin/bluez-pin;</tt>
<li>Think about scatternets--if you have "master" in hcid.conf's lm setting, you are forcing the pc to be master. This may not jive well with a combo headset.
</ul>
