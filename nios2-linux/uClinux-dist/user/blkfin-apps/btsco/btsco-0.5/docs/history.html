The Linux drivers for audio have gone through some experimental
stages.  It's worth explaining where each of these experiments fits
into the big picture and what we learned.

<h3>Early work</h3>

Development started with the btsco daemon and the snd-bt-sco kernel
module.  The daemon opens a data connection to a HSP headset and works
in conjunction with the kernel audio driver snd-bt-sco to provide an
alsa device to send and receive headset audio. btsco2 takes a slightly
different approach and runs in the place of the original btsco daemon.

<p>

Work with A2DP started with a basic SBC encoder that used
floating-point math to compress the audio stream. Negotiating the
connection to the headset and transmitting the stream was tested and
realized using a standalone application, a2play. This application does
not work well with other apps; audio is typically piped in using
standard input rather than working as a normal audio device. There is
another application, a2recv, that listens for incoming streaming audio
and plays the stream on the computer's built-in speakers.

<p>

Some rudimentary experimenting with AVRCP resulted in two different
test applications: avrecv listens for an AVRCP connection from a
headset and displays received messages on the console. avsnd makes the
outbound connection to the specified headset and similarly listens for
messages.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

It became apparent that the audio driver inside the kernel was not the 
best solution to the problem of making a driver. Audio architectures like
the userspace library side of alsa provide a way for audio drivers like
bluetooth to be implemented entirely in userspace which is proving to be
a better fit.

<p>

A2DP similarly needed a userspace alsa plugin in order to make it work
with mp3 players and movie players.

<p>

An additional complication is the fact that the alsa interface is too
simplistic to cover the advanced signaling that bluetooth provides,
like ringing a headset and waiting for an answer or responding to a
track advance event from an A2DP/AVRCP set.

<h3>Alsa plugin progress</h3>

A first pass at the A2DP plugin resulted in a plugin that communicates
directly with the headset without any intermediate application. This
proved to be too simplistic since only one application could use the
set. Some audio applications would lock up the headphones by
repeatedly opening and closing the audio device because these
operations were translated into opening and closing the bluetooth
audio link.

<p>

The first attempt at SCO alsa plugin fortunately involved an
intermediate daemon to mitigate some of these issues.

<p>

As a second iteration on A2DP alsa plugins, a daemon ("a2dpd") was
designed to control connections to the headphones and to mix audio
from multiple applications together.

<h3>SBC encoding</h3>

Adaptations in the SBC encoder allowed it to run on small computers
without a floating point coprocessor. For the first time, our A2DP
transmission was scaled down enough to operate on cellphone-class
devices. Unfortunately, some quality problems were introduced, such as
low volume and occasional overflows when the input volume is high
(manifest as a popping sound).

<p>

The fixed-point-only SBC encoder was moved into its own project on
sourceforge, and unfortunately the continued presence of the (messier)
combined fixed-point/floating-point code in the btsco project has been
a source for some confusion.
