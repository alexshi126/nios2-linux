This project aims to make bluetooth headsets of all types work well
with Linux computers, from a standard desktop to a limited embedded
device.

<h3>Voice headsets</h3>

The most common use of bluetooth audio is to make a wireless
connection to a cellphone. This is typically done using a small
headset that fits over one ear. These headsets don't deliver
outstanding audio quality. A headset used for a phone call should not
introduce much delay. A special transport, Synchronous
Connection-Oriented, or SCO, was invented to provide this low-delay
monophonic audio with voice-quality fidelity.

<p>

SCO headsets have one or both of two profiles for 2-way voice
communication.

<p>

The simpler profile is the Headset Profile, or HSP. It provides for a
way to tap a button to start or end a call and buttons for controlling
audio levels.

<p>

The more advanced Hands-free Profile, HFP, adds a host of optional
functions like call rejection, last-number redial, caller id display,
and dialing specific phone numbers.

<h3>High-fidelity audio</h3>

The advanced audio distribution profile, A2DP, provides the basis for
high-fidelity audio. The bandwidth of bluetooth cannot accommodate
uncompressed high-quality stereo audio, so the audio stream must be
digitally compressed.

<p>

Pausing, playing, advancing the track are features of the AVRCP
profile, most commonly combined with A2DP.
