# Rate
# use 32000 if your headset seems to not support 44100 (HP works well at 44100, Sonorix at 32000)
# However, 44100 is mandatory
#
rate=44100
#rate=32000

#
# plugin-rate default is the rate used between the plugin and the daemon
# if this value is 0 then 
# if this value is not 0 then alsa will convert all stream to the specified rate and then send it to the daemon
# if this value is 0, then alsa will do no conversion at all, the daemon will do it's own resampling.
# This "features" is disabled because of the crappy quality of the daemon resampler
# To test a2dpd resampling from 32000 to 44100 use plugin-rate=32000 and rate=44100
#plugin-rate=32000
