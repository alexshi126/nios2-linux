.TH mpd.conf 5
.SH NAME
mpd.conf \- Music Player Daemon configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmpd.conf\fP is the configuration file for mpd(1).  If not specified on the
command line, MPD first searches for it at \fB~/.mpdconf\fP and then in
\fB/etc/mpd.conf\fP.

Lines beginning with a "#" character are comments.  All other non-empty lines
specify parameters and their values.  These lines contain the parameter name
and parameter value (surrounded by double quotes) separated by whitespace
(either tabs or spaces).  For example:

parameter "value"

The exception to this rule is the audio_output parameter, which is of the form:

audio_output {
.br
        parameter1 "value"
        parameter2 "value"
.br
}

Parameters that take a file or directory as an argument should use absolute
paths.

See \fBdocs/mpdconf.example\fP in the source tarball for an example
configuration file.
.SH REQUIRED PARAMETERS

should be unique to your local network, but name collisions will be properly
dealt with.
.TP
.B password <password@permissions>
This specifies a password for access to mpd.  The format is
"password@permissions" where permissions is a comma delimited list composed
of "read", "add", "control", and/or "admin".  "read" allows for reading of the
database, displaying the current playlist, and current status of mpd.  "add"
allows for adding songs and loading playlists.  "control" allows for all other
player and playlist manipulations.  "admin" allows the db to be updated and for
the client to kill mpd.  An example value is "somePassword@read,add".  Multiple
password parameters may be specified.
.TP
.B default_permissions <permissions>
This specifies the permissions of a client that has not been authenticated
using a password.  The format of permissions is specified in the description of
the "password" config parameter.  If no passwords are specified, the default is
"read,add,control,admin", otherwise it is "" (no permissions).
.TP
.B audio_output
See \fBDESCRIPTION\fP and the various \fBAUDIO OUTPUT PARAMETERS\fP sections
for the format of this parameter.  Multiple audio_output sections may be

character sets can be obtained by running "iconv -l".  The default is
determined from the locale when the db was originally created.
.TP
.B id3v1_encoding <charset>
This specifies the character set which ID3v1 tags are encoded in.  A list of
supported character sets can be obtained by running "iconv -l".  The default is

do no additional conversion.
.TP
.B gapless_mp3_playback <yes or no>
This specifies whether to support gapless playback of MP3s which have the
necessary headers.  Useful if your MP3s have headers with incorrect
information.  If you have such MP3s, it is highly recommended that you fix them
using vbrfix (available from <http://www.willwap.co.uk/Programs/vbrfix.php>)
instead of disabling gapless MP3 playback.  The default is to support gapless
MP3 playback.
.TP
